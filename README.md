# Rice Type Classification using PyTorch

This project demonstrates a simple neural network model built using PyTorch for classifying rice types based on a dataset of rice image features.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Rice Type Classification" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains various features extracted from rice images, such as area, perimeter, and eccentricity, along with a class label for each rice type.


## Project Structure

The project is structured as a Google Colab notebook that performs the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Downloads the dataset from Kaggle using the `opendatasets` library.
   - Loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Handles missing values and removes unnecessary columns.
   - Normalizes the feature data.
2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Splits the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. **Dataset Creation:**
   - Creates PyTorch Datasets and DataLoaders for efficient data handling during training and evaluation.
4. **Model Definition:**
   - Defines a simple neural network model using the `nn.Module` class in PyTorch.
5. **Training:**
   - Defines a loss function and an optimizer.
   - Trains the model for a specified number of epochs.
   - Tracks training loss and accuracy, as well as validation loss and accuracy during each epoch.
6. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluates the model's performance on the test dataset.
   - Prints the test loss and accuracy.
7. **Prediction:**
   - Prompts the user to input feature values.
   - Uses the trained model to predict the class of rice based on the user's input.



## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:

- `opendatasets`: For downloading the dataset.
- `torch`: The PyTorch library for building and training neural networks.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `sklearn`: For data splitting and evaluation metrics.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.

## How to Run

1. **Open Google Colab:** Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. **Upload or Create a Notebook:** Upload the notebook file or create a new notebook.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Run the cells containing the `!pip install` commands to install the necessary libraries.
4. **Run the Notebook:** Run the cells sequentially to load the data, train the model, evaluate the model, and make predictions.
5. **Input Feature Values:** When prompted, enter the feature values for rice to predict its class.

## Potential Improvements

- **More Advanced Model:** Explore more complex neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for potentially better performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of hidden layers, and number of neurons per layer, to optimize the model's performance.
- **Data Augmentation:** Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explore creating new features based on the existing ones to potentially improve the model's accuracy.
